MCX, or Malapoa College Exponential, is an innovative project initiated by Malapoa College. This locally inspired effort, crafted in collaboration with Viewpoint Exploration (ViewpeX), seeks to unlock the power of exponential ideas in education. By tailoring features from the Moodle Learning Management System and Google Classroom, MCX is designed to meet the distinct learning needs and context of Vanuatu.

Currently, MCX is being developed with several key objectives: 1) To deliver learning opportunities to students wherever they are in Vanuatu, 2) To provide a clear roadmap for student learning aligned with the Vanuatu Curriculum, and 3) To create an interactive learning environment supported by AI Teaching Agents.
